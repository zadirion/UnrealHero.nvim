# UnrealHero.nvim

Nvim configuration suitable for development in Unreal Engine

*Requirements:*
- requires python 3.11 (3.12 doesn't work) installed and in your PATH environment variable. This is because UnrealHero relies on UltiSnips for snippet completion

Comes with https://github.com/zadirion/Unreal.nvim, my neovim plugin that adds support for Unreal Engine
